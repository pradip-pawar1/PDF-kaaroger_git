# PDF - Kaariger

**PDF - Kaariger** ("Kaariger" means craftsman in Hindi) is not just a script -it's your command-line artisan for working with PDFs. Crafted with raw python and powered by [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), this tool is designed to evolve into a full-fledge **GUI-based PDF toolkit**.

From simple merging to advanced manipulation, PDF - Kaariger aims to be your go-to companion for all PDF needs, especially for those who value simplicity, control, and offline functionality.

## Current Features
Easily merge multiple PDF files into one clean, organized document - all in just a few lines of python.

## Upcoming Features (Work in progress)
We're building this into a full suite. Here's what's comming next:
- PDF Size Compressor
- Image Extractor
- PDF Splitter
- PDF to Format Converter
- Page Re-arranger
- GUI Application (Tkinter)
- Password Protection & Decryption
- Smart Mode (AI)

Some tools should feel _local, simple, and powerful_.

No ads. No unnecessary UI. Just Power and peace.
